<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was built to solve Sudoku's using different algorithms. The main reason is that i like Sudoku and find it interesting to use algorithms to solve the problem. The algorithms that I used in this project resulted from some research in books and websites. I decided to record th execution times of the different algorithms to have a slight ideia of which is the fastest. It is importatnt to note that the measured times are not very representative of the real execution times because the machines were the program runs usually have programs running in background.
For testing purposes there is a Batch Mode to run multiple tests that calculates the average execution time of each algorithm.

The algorithms used so far include:
* Backtracking Algorithm
* Dancing Links Algorithm (next iteration)


### Built With

* [Java](https://www.java.com/download/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get started all you need to do is to is to clone the repository and compile the project.

### Prerequisites

The only prerequisite to run this program is to have Java installed in your machine.


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To run the static example you just need to run the SudokuTester class.
